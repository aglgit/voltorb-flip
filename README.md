# Voltorb Flip

![Build](https://github.com/aglgit/voltorb-flip/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This is a project for me to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript.

It is heavily based on Voltorb Flip by [Brandon Stein](https://voltorbflip.brandon-stein.com/) as well as the [original game](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_Flip).
